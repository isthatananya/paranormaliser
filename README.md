# Paranormaliser

Paranormaliser is a retro-themed web application designed to simulate interactive paranormal experiences through natural language. It presents a vintage terminal-style interface that allows users to ask questions and receive eerie, stylized responses powered by AI.

## Concept

The core idea behind Paranormaliser is to blend modern language generation technology with an old-school aesthetic reminiscent of early personal computers. By recreating the atmosphere of late-90s or early-2000s internet terminals, the application evokes a sense of nostalgia while engaging users with creative, story-like responses to their prompts.

The system mimics a haunted console or paranormal advisor, offering cryptic or unsettling replies based on the user's input. This is achieved using advanced text generation models that are capable of interpreting natural language and generating thematically consistent outputs.
